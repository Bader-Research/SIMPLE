# SIMPLE

SIMPLE is a framework for implementation of parallel algorithms using
our methodology for developing high performance programs running on
clusters of SMP nodes. Our methodology is based on a small kernel
(SIMPLE) of collective communication primitives that make efficient
use of the hybrid shared and message passing environment. We
illustrate the power of our methodology by presenting experimental
results for sorting integers, two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms
(FFT), and constraint-satisfied searching.
